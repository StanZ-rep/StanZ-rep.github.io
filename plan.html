    <h1>After you have completed your booking, you will receive a confirmation code â€“ this is what you need for
        check-in.

        <p>A travel itinerary will be sent to your email address, which includes:</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>a unique confirmation code</li>
                <li>flight number</li>
                <li>the date and time of travel</li>
                <li>departure and destination details</li>
                <li>full cost</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>For passengers booking flights via a travel agency or a third-party website, the itinerary will be provided
            by
            the
            travel agent. If the reservation was created not by you, any flight related changes will be communicated to
            the
            contact details of the booking owner.</p>
